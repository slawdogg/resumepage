<p>This is a lottery number generator that generates random numbers for the Powerball and MegaMillions lotteries. It also has the capability to download the past drawings of the Powerball and MegaMillions lotteries from the New York State Lottery at data.gov.</p>
<h3><br><b>NOTE:</b><i>This application is for entertainment purposes only! I make no guarantees of wealth!</h3></i></h3>
    <h4><p>This started as a number counter to a fun little project to see if a lottery number could be predicted. While this is highly unlikely,
        it was a fun what if project. All this really is is a random number generator. However, I added the capability to download 
    the past drawings of the Powerball and MegaMillions multi state lotteries from the <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?organization_type=State+Government&tags=new-york-lottery">New York State Lottery</a> at data.gov. </p>

    <h3><br>How to use the app:</h3>
    <br>Once numbers are generated, they are counted in the lottery CSV file and output on a popup window.
        They are also saved in a separate text file so they can be reviewed later.</h4>
